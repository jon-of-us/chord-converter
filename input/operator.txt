G  Bm                    C                  G

Operator, well could you help me place this call

Am                    D                   Em  D

See the number on the matchbook is old an faded

G                 Bm

She's living in L.A

        C                  G

With my best old ex friend Ray

Am               D7                      Em  D C Bm D

Guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated

 

    G              C               G

But isn't that the way they say it goes

             C       D

But let's forget all that

    G                     Am

And give me the number if you can find it

C  D     Em           D             Em          C

So I can call just to tell them I'm fine and to show

         D        C

I've overcome the blow

                Em      G

I've learned to take it well

       Am      C                   G

I only wish my words could just convince myself

        C           D

That it just wasn't real

    C                     G

But that's not the way it feels

 

G  Bm                    C                  G

Operator, well could you help me place this call

Am                     D                    Em     D

Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me

G                       Bm

There's something in my eyes

            C             G

You know it happens every time

  Am              D7                        Em     D C Bm D

I think about the love that I thought would save me

 

    G              C               G

But isn't that the way they say it goes

            C        D

But let's forget all that

    G                     Am

And give me the number if you can find it

C  D     Em           D             Em          C

But that's not the way it feels

                C                     G

No, no, no, no, that's not the way it feels

 

G  Bm              C              G

Operator, let's forget about this call

Am                     D                Em     D

There's no one there I really wanted to talk to

G                  Bm

Thank you for your time

               C                 G

Oh you've been so much more than kind

Am      D7       Em  D C Bm D

You can keep the dime

 

    G              C               G

But isn't that the way they say it goes

             C        D

    G                     Am
