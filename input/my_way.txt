[Verse 1]

    C               Cmaj7

And now, the end is near,

         C7            A7

And so I face the final curtain,

    Dm7                Dm7/C

My friend. I'll say it clear,

             Dm7/B   G7       C

I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

     C                   C7

I've lived a life that's full.

            F             Fm

I traveled each and every highway,

    C                    G       Gsus4   F    C

And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.

 

 

[Verse 2]

    C               Cmaj7

Regrets, I've had a few,

         C7                A7

But then again, too few to mention.

  Dm7               Dm7/C

I did what I had to do,

           Dm7/B   G7    C

And saw it thru without exemption.

  C                    C7

I planned each charted course,

             F              Fm

Each careful step along the byway,

    C                    G     Gsus4    F        C

And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.

 

 

[Verse 3]

               C                   C7

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,

           F                     Fsus4 F

When I bit off more than I could chew,

            Dm               G7

But thru it all, when there was doubt,

         Em               Am7

I ate it up, and spit it out.

           Dm               G

I faced it all, and I stood tall,

   Gsus4    F       C

And did it m      y way.

 

 

[Verse 4]

    C               Cmaj7

I've loved, I've laughed and cried.

         C7                A7

I've had my fill; my share of losing.

  Dm7               Dm7/C

And now, as tears subside,

           Dm7/B   G7    C

I find it all so  amusing.

  C                    C7

To think I did all that;

             F              Fm

And may I say - not in a shy way,

    C   G       Gsus4        F    C

"No, oh no not me, I did it m   y way".

 

 

[Verse 5]

               C               C7

For what is a man, what has he got?

              F

If not himself, then he has naught.

         Dm7               G7

To say the things he truly feels;  

           Em                Am7

And not the words of one who kneels.

           Dm7               G         Gsus4    F      C

The record shows I took the blows - And did it m   y way!
