[Verse 1]

C         Bm7     E7                 Am     Am/G

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away

F       G7                     C            C/B Am  D7      

 Now it looks as though they're here to stay, oh I believe in

 F C C

 yesterday

 

[Verse 2]

C        Bm7      E7             Am         Am/G

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be

F         G7             C        C/B Am   D7       F C C

 There's a shadow hanging over me, oh yesterday came suddenly

 

[Chorus]

Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G F         Dm        G        C

Why she  had to   go I don't know, she wouldn't say

Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G  F           Dm       G     C

I   said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

 

[Verse 3]

C         Bm7       E7           Am          Am/G

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play

F     G7              C          C/B Am  D7       F C C

 Now I need a place to hide away, oh  I believe in yesterday

 

[Chorus]

Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G F           Dm       G       C

 Why she  had to   go I don't know, she wouldn't say

Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G  F           Dm       G     C

I   said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

 

[Verse]

C        Bm7        E7           Am           Am/G

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play

F     G7              C          C/B Am  D7       F C C

 Now I need a place to hide away, oh  I believe in yesterday
