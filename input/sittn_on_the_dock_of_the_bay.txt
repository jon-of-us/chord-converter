SITTIN ON THE DOCK OF THE BAY

G

 


 

[Verse 1]

 

G                      B7

Sittin' in the mornin' sun

        C                        A

I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come

G                       B7

Watching the ships roll in

          C                    A

Then I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah

 

[Chorus]

 

    G                          E

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

             G          E

Watching the tide roll away

              G                          A

Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay

        G  E

Wastin' time

 

[Verse 2]

 

  G               B7

I left my home in Georgia

C                      A

Headed for the 'Frisco Bay

G                 B7

I have nothing to live for

          C                      A

Look like nothin's gonna come my way

 

[Chorus]

 

                  G                      E

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay

             G          E

Watching the tide roll away

         G                          A

Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

        G  E

Wastin' time

 

[Bridge]

 

G     D     C               G

 Look like, nothing's gonna change

G    D             C         G

Everything still remains the same

G       D       C          G

I can't do what ten people tell me to do

F                  D

 So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

 

[Verse 3]

 

G                       B7

Sittin' here resting my bones

         C                          A

And this loneliness won't leave me alone

     G                    B7

It's two thousand miles I roam

        C                 A

Just to make this dock my home

 

[Chorus]

 

                   G                      E

Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay

             G          E

Watching the tide roll away

         G                          A

Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

        G  E

Wastin' time

 

[Whistling]
