SKYLINE_PIGEON

[Verse 1]

          C               G/B

Turn me loose from your hands

      F  G      G7      C

Let me fly to distant lands

             D/F#             F

Over green fields, trees and mountains

C/G    G       G7      C

Flowers and forest fountains

F         C/G        G7      C

Home along the lanes of the skyway

 

[Verse 2]

          C              G/B

For this dark and lonely room

           F    G   G7      C

Projects a shadow cast in gloom

                D/F#

And my eyes are mirrors

       F

Of the world outside

         C/G

Thinking of the way

G        G7             C

That the wind can turn he tide

           F

And these shadows turn

      C/G    G7    C

From purple into grey

 

[Chorus]

              F

For just this Skyline Pigeon

C/G             G7

Dreaming of the open

C

Waiting for the day

        F

He can spread his wings

    C/G   G7   C      E7/B

And fly away again

      Am  B7            Em

Fly away  Skyline pigeon fly

             F                 C/G  G7    C

Towards the dreams you left so very far behind

(repeat from fly away)

 

[Verse 3]

         C

Just let me wake up in the morning

       G/B

to the smell of new mown hay

        F  G      G7

to laugh and cry, to live and die

      C

I the brightness of my day

 

       D/F#

I want to hear the pealing bells

       F

Of distant churches sing

    C/G    G       G7

But most of all please free me

        C

from this aching metal ring

  F         C/G        G7      C

and open out this cage towards the sun

 

(Repeat chorus)
