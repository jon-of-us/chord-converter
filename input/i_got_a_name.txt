I GOT A NAME
Jim Croce

[Verse 1]

 

C                    G                  Am

 Like the pine trees linin' the windin' road

            F     G           C

 I've got a name, I've got a name

C                 G                     Am

 Like the singin' bird and the croakin' toad

            D7               G

 I've got a name, I've got a name

 

 

[Chorus]

 

Em              F               C

 And I carry it with me like my daddy did

Em                  Am                 G

 But I'm livin' the dream that he kept hid

 

 Em                 F

 Movin' me down the highway

 Em                  A7

 Rollin' me down the highway

 F               G                  C

 Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

 

 

[Verse 2]

 

C                    G                  Am

 Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky

            F     G          C

 I've got a song, I've got a song

C                 G                   Am

 Like the whippoorwill and the baby's cry

            D7               G

 I've got a song, I've got a song

 

 

[Chorus]

 

Em              F             C

 And I carry it with me and I sing it loud

Em              Am                    G

 If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud

 

 Em                 F

 Movin' me down the highway

 Em                  A7

 Rollin' me down the highway

 F               G                  C

 Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

 

 

[Solo]

C    G    Am Am7

F    G    C

C    G    Am Am7

D7   G

 

 

[Bridge]

 

C

 And I'm gonna go there free

 

 

[Chorus]

 

C                G                  Am

 Like the fool I am and I'll always be

            F      G           C

 I've got a dream, I've got a dream

C                      G                           Am

 They can change their minds but they can't change me

            D7                G

 I've got a dream, I've got a dream

 

Em                  F               C

 Oh, I know I could share it if you want me to

Em               Am                   G

 If you're going my way, I'll go with you

 

 

[Outro/Chorus]

 

 Em                 F

 Movin' me down the highway

 Em                  A7

 Rollin' me down the highway

 F               G                  C

 Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

 

 Em                 F

 Movin' me down the highway

 Em                  A7

 Rollin' me down the highway

 F               G                  C

 Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by
