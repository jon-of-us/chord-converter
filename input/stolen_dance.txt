STOLEN DANCE
Milky Chance

[Intro]

G#m F# E B D#7 x2
 

[Verse]

G#m       F#     E

I want you by my side

B                    D#7

So that I never feel alone again

G#m           F#     E

They've always been so kind

B                           D#7

But now they've brought you away from here

G#m         F#            E

I hope they didn't get your mind

B                        D#7

Your heart is too strong anyway

G#m       F#            E

We need to fetch back the time

B                     D#7

They have stolen from us

 

[Chorus]

E

And I want you

B

We can bring it on the floor

             D#7             G#m

You've never danced like this before

             F#

But we don't talk about it

E                     B

Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long

D#7         G#m

Stoned in paradise

F#

Shouldn't talk about it

 

E

And I want you

B

We can bring it on the floor

             D#7             G#m

You've never danced like this before

             F#

But we don't talk about it

E                     B

Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long

D#7         G#m

Stoned in paradise

N.C.

Shouldn't talk about it

Shouldn't talk about it

[Verse]

G#m       F#     E

Coldest winter for me

B                 D#7

No sun is shining anymore

G#m       F#     E

The only thing I feel is pain

B                 D#7

Caused by absence of you

G#m       F#     E

Suspense is controlling my mind

B                 D#7

I cannot find the way out of here

G#m       F#     E

I want you by my side

B                    D#7

So that I never feel alone again

 

[Chorus]

E

And I want you

B

We can bring it on the floor

             D#7             G#m

You've never danced like this before

             F#

But we don't talk about it

E                     B

Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long

D#7         G#m

Stoned in paradise

F#

Shouldn't talk about it

 

E

And I want you

B

We can bring it on the floor

             D#7             G#m

You've never danced like this before

             F#

But we don't talk about it

E                     B

Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long

D#7         G#m

Stoned in paradise

Shouldn't talk about it

Shouldn't talk about it
