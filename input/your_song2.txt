YOUR SONG

[Intro]

D#  G#  A#  G#

 

 

[Verse 1]

D#                G#maj7 A#/D             Gm

It's a little bit funny,   this feeling inside

Cm             Cm/A#      Cm/A      G#maj7

I'm not one of those who can easily hide

D#                 A#       G         Cm

I don't have much money, but boy, if I did

D#            Fm7        G#              A#

I'd buy a big house where we both could live

 

D#            G#maj7 A#/D              Gm

If I was a sculptor,   but then again, no

     Cm            Cm/A#      Cm/A         G#

Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show

   D#            A#                G        Cm

I know it's not much but it's the best I can do

D#             Fm7     G#               D#

My gift is my song, and this one's for you

 

 

[Chorus]

A#/D              Cm      Fm7            G#maj7

And you can tell everybody this is your song

A#/D       Cm            Fm               G#

It may be quite simple but now that it's done

Cm                    Cm/A#

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

Cm/A                G#6

That I put down in words,

      D#/G    Fm            G#            A#

How wonderful life is while you're in the world

 

 

[Interlude]

D#  G#  A#  G#

 

 

[Verse 2]

D#           G#maj7 A#/D                 Gm

I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss

        Cm          Cm/A#             Cm/A           G#maj7

Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross

D#                   A#       G                   Cm

But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song

D#                   Fm7     G#               A#

It's for people like you that keep it turned on

 

D#              G#maj7   A#/D                Gm

So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do

Cm               Cm/A#             Cm/A             G#maj7

You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue

D#                 A#                G     Cm

Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean

D#              Fm7        G#             D#

Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

 

 

[Chorus]

A#/D              Cm      Fm7            G#

And you can tell everybody this is your song

A#/D       Cm            Fm               G#

It may be quite simple but now that it's done

Cm                    Cm/A#

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

Cm/A                G#6

That I put down in words,

      D#       Fm            G#             A#

How wonderful life is while you're in the world

 

Cm                   Cm/A#

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

Cm/A                G#6

That I put down in words,

     D#/G     Fm            G#            D#      G#/D# A#/D# G#/D# D#

How wonderful life is while you're in the world
