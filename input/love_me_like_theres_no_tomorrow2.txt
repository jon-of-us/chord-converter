LOVE ME LIKE THERES NO TOMORROW

Freddie Mercury

 
[Verse 1]

Dm                         Gm

 You had to kill the conversation,

C                        F

 you always had the upper hand,

A#                                 Fadd9

 Got Caught In love and stepped in sinking sand,

C                       F

 you had to go and ruin all our plans

A                                   Dm

 Packed your bags and you're leaving home,

      F                         C

got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go,

Em                              A

 but we only have one more day together, so...

 

[Chorus]

 D                   F#m   G

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 Em                              A

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 D                 F#m             G              Em

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 Em                          A          D

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow

 

[Verse 2]

Dm                          Gm

 I guess we drift alone in separate ways,

C                             F

 I don't have all that far to go,

A#                              Fadd9

 God Knows I learnt to play the lonely man,

C                         F

 I've never felt so low in all my life,

A                       Dm

 we were born to be Just losers,

      F                         C

so I guess there's a limit on how far we go,

Em                              A

 but we only have one more day together, so...

 

[Chorus]

 D                   F#m   G

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 Em                              A

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 D                 F#m             G              Em

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 Em                          A          D

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow

 

[Bridge]

 F                        C

Tomorrow God knows just where I'll be,

 F                       C

Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me

 Cm                            A#                       F

Anything could happen but we only have one more day together, yeah,

 Fm                   A#

Just one more day forever,

 

[Chorus]

 D#                  Gm   G#

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 Fm                              A#

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 D#                Gm             G#             Fm

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 Fm                          A#         D#

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow

 

 D#                  Gm   G#

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 Fm                              A#

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 D#                Gm             G#             Fm

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 Fm                          A#         D#

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
