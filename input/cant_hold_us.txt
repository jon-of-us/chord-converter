Return of the Mack, get em

        G   Gsus4

What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t.

              Em

Looking for a better way to get up out of bed

                          F

Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, Get up! 

Am                                     G Gsus4

Fresh out pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious

             Em                                    F

Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweatergang nope, nope y’all can’t copy

     Am                      G Gsus4                 Em

Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,

F

And we did it, our way.

      Am                       G Gsus4                       Em

Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it

    F

And yet I’m on.

          Am                           G Gsus4          Em                                 F

Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.

N.C.   Am                               G Gsus4

Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,

                 Em                        F

But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Am                      G Gsus4            Em

Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,

                     F                  Am                  G Gsus4

Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussin' halfway cross that city with

     Em                                         F

the back (back) pack (pack) fat (fat) cat (cat), crushing

           Am

Labels out here,

                       G Gsus4

Nah, they can’t tell me nothin'

                      Em

We give that to the people,

                      F

Spread it across the country

           N.C.

Labels out here, Nah they can’t tell me nothin'

                  N.C.

We give it to the people, spread it across the country

 

[Chorus]

        Am                  G Gsus4

Here we go back, this is the moment

               Em                           F

Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over

                    Am                        G Gsus4

So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us

Em                         F

    Like the ceiling can’t hold us

       Am                    G Gsus4

Here we go back, this is the moment

               Em                           F

Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over

                    Am                        G Gsus4

So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us

Em                         F

    Like the ceiling can’t hold us

 

[Verse]

N.C.

Nah, can I kick it? thank you. Yeah, I'm so damn grateful.

N.C.

I grew up, really wanted gold fronts

N.C.

But that’s what you get when Wu-tang raised you

N.C.

Y’all can’t stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat

N.C.

And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week

Am

Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!

C                                G                                  Am

Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,

                            Am                                   C

Caesar make you a believer. nah I never ever did it for a throne.

                                     G                                Am

That validation comes from giving it back to the people. nah sing a song and it goes like

Am                   C

  Raise those hands, this is our party

    G                             Am

We came here to live life like nobody was watching

         Am                         C

I got my city right behind me. If I fall, they got me.

                G                         N.C.

Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marchin', ourselves

 

[Chorus]

        Am                  G Gsus4

Here we go back, this is the moment

               Em                           F

Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over

                    Am                        G Gsus4

Em                         F

    Like the ceiling can’t hold us

       Am                    G Gsus4

                    Am                        G Gsus4

So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us

Em                         N.C.

    Like the ceiling can’t hold us
