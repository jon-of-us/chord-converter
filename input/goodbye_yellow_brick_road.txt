[Intro]
F C/E Dm Dm/C 

Bb F/C C F 


[Verse 1]
Gm7          Bb         C     C/E
When are you gonna come down?
F            F/A      Bb
When are you going to land?
 Eb           Eb/Bb         C7
I should have stayed on the farm, should have
F                  F
Listened to my old man
    Gm7            Bb         C
You know you can't hold me forever
  F           F/A     Bb
I didn't sign up with you
    Eb    Eb/Bb            C7
I'm not a present for your friends to open
     F                     F
This boy's too young to be singing

[Bridge 1]
    Bbm   Bbm/F   Eb   Eb/G
The blues...    
Ab   Ab/C   Db   Db/C
Ah......    Ah....
Bbm   Bbm/F   C
Ah....        Ah...
 
[Chorus]
   F                    A7
So goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F
Where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm7
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F     F/E
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A7 
Back to the howling old owl in the woods 
Bb                     Db
Hunting the horny back toad
   Eb   F         F/E      Dm       Dm/C
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      BbC           
Beyond the yellow brick  

[Bridge 2]
Bbm   Bbm/F   Eb   Eb/G
road ...
Ab   Ab/C   Db   Db/C
Ah.....     Ah......
Bbm   Bbm/F   C     F
Ah...         Ah... Ah...
 
[Verse 2]
Gm7         Bb           C         C/E
What do you think you'll do then?
  F                 F/A      Bb
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
      Eb         Eb/Bb     C7
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
   F                      F
To set you on your feet again
Gm7          Bb    C
Maybe you'll get a replacement
        F           F/A       Bb
There's plenty like me to be found
Eb      Eb/Bb     C  
Mongrels      who ain't got a penny
F                         F
Sniffing for tidbits like you 

[Bridge 1]
       Bbm   Bbm/F   Eb   Eb/G
On the ground ...
Ab   Ab/C   Db   Db/C
Ah.....     Ah......
Bbm   Bbm/F   C    
Ah...         Ah...
 
[Chorus]
   F                    A7
So goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F
Where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm7
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F     F/E
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A7 
Back to the howling old owl in the woods 
Bb                     Db
Hunting the horny back toad
   Eb   F         F/E      Dm       Dm/C
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      BbC           
Beyond the yellow brick
