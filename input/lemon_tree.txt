LEMON TREE 

[Intro]

Am Em Am Em Dm Em Am | Em  Am

[Verse 1]
    Am                Em
I'm sitting here in a boring room,
     Am                        Em
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
    Am                     Em
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
    Am                  Em
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
    Dm           Em              Am      | Em  Am
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

 

[Verse 2]
    Am               Em
I'm driving around - in my car,
    Am                    Em
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
    Am                Em
I'd like to change my point of view
  Am                  Em
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    Dm           Em              Am      | Em  Am
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

 

[Chorus]
  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G                    C           G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
    C                 G
I'm turning my head - up and down,
    Am                              Em
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    F              F#dim7              G           G7
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

 

[Interlude]
Am  Am  Em  Em  Am  Am  Em  Em  Dm  Dm  Em  Em  Am   | Em  Am
Dam     dadoudi....

[Verse 3]
    Am              Em
I'm sitting here, I miss the power.
    Am                 Em
I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
    Am                    Em
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
  Am                   Em
I feel so tired, put myself into bed,
      Dm           Em              Am      | Em  Am
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

 

[Bridge]
E           Am
Isolation - Is not good for me,
G           C               E
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.

 

[Verse 4]
    Am                   Em
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Am                    Em
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
    Dm              Em               Am      | Em  Am
And everything will happen - and you wonder.

 

[Chorus]
  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G                    C           G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
    C                 G
I'm turning my head - up and down,
    Am                              Em
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    F              F#dim7              G           G7
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

 

[Outro]
  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G        F              G
And all that I can see, and all that I can see,
    F              G                    C
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
