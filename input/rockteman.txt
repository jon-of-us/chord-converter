ROCKTMAN



[Verse 1]

Am7                                    D

   She packed my bags last night - pre-flight

Am7                D

   Zero hour, nine A.M.

F                  C/E     Dm    Dm/C              G/B   G

  And I'm gonna be high -i-high       as a kite by then

Am7                            D

   I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife

Am7                   D

   It's lonely out in space                                   ^ ^

F           C/E     Dm             Dm/C    G/B   G/D   G     F

  On such a ti - i -imeless flight

 

 

[Chorus]

C                                      F

 And I think it's gonna be a long long time

                                        C

Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

                                   F

I'm not the man they think I am at home

           C/E       D

Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man

F                                   C           F

Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

 

C                                      F

 And I think it's gonna be a long long time

                                        C

Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

                                   F

I'm not the man they think I am at home

           C/E       D

Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man

F                                   C           F

Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

 

 

[Verse 2]

Am7                              D

   Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids

Am7                      D

    In fact it's cold as hell

F                     C/E      Dm         Dm/C         G/B   G/D   G

   And there's no one there to raise them       if you did

Am7                                     D

    And all this science, I don't under stand

Am7                              D

    It's just my job five days a week

       F     C           Dm    Dm/C        G/B   G/D   G

Rocket man  -aaa  -a -a- an         rocket man

 

 

[Chorus]

C                                      F

 And I think it's gonna be a long long time

                                        C

Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

                                   F

I'm not the man they think I am at home

           C/E        D

Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man

F                                   C           F

Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

 

C                                       F

  And I think it's gonna be a long long time

                                        C

Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

                                   F

I'm not the man they think I am at home

           C/E       D

Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man

F                                   C

Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

 

 

[Outro]

F                             C

  And I think it's gonna be a long long time

F                             C

  And I think it's gonna be a long long time
