TEAR IN MY HEART
Twenty One Pilots 

[Intro]

D - D - D - D

F#m - F#m  G - G

 

 

[Verse 1]

                              D F#m G

 Sometimes you gotta bleed to know

                              D F#m G

 That you're alive and have a soul

                               A7

 But it takes someone to come around to show you how

 

 

[Chorus]

                      G           A

 She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive

                      Bm            A

 She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire

                      D              A                          D F#m G

 She's the tear in my heart, take me higher than I've ever been

 

 

[Verse 2]

                            D F#m G

 The songs on the radio are okay

                               D F#m G

 But my taste in music is your face

                              A7

 And it takes a song to come around to show you how

 

 

[Chorus]

                      G           A

 She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive

                      Bm            A

 She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire

                      D              A                     G

 She's the tear in my heart, take me higher than I've ever been

                Bm   A

 Than I've ever been

                D    A

 Than I've ever been

                D

 Than I've ever been

 

 

[Bridge]

D

 You fell asleep in my car

D

 I drove the whole time

D

 But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine

D

 I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government

D

 For not using my taxes

D

 To fill holes with more cement

D

 You fell asleep in my car

D

 I drove the whole time

D

 But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine

D

 I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government

D

 For not using my taxes

D

 To fill holes with more cement

 

 

[Verse 3]

                              D F#m G

 Sometimes you gotta bleed to know

                              D F#m G

 That you're alive and have a soul

                               D        F#m       G

 But it takes someone to come around to show you how

 

 

[Chorus]

                      G           A

 She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive

                      Bm            A

 She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire

                      D              A                N.C.

 She's the tear in my heart, take me higher than I've ever been

    G

 My heart is my armor

 A                    Bm             A

 She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver

 D                      A                                     G

 She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther, than I've ever been

                Bm   A

 Than I've ever been

                D    A

 Than I've ever been

                G

 Than I've ever been

    G

 My heart is my armor

 A                    Bm             A

 She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver

                           D                  A                   G

 She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther, than I've ever been

 

End on D
