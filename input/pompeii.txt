POMPEII


[Intro]

F  C  Am  G (x2)

 

 

[Verse 1]

F          C         Am          G

I was left to my own de-v-i-c-e-s

 F         C              Am         G

Many days fell away with nothing to show

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

         F                   C

And the walls kept tumbling down

                   Am       G

In the city that we l-o-v-e-d

        F                   C

Great clouds roll over the hills

                       Am      G

Bringing darkness from a-b-o-v-e

 

 

[Chorus]

N.C.                   F

But if you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

 Am                G

Nothing changed at all?

                       F

And if you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

 Am                 G

You've been here before?

     F                C         G

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

     F                C         G

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

 

 

[Verse 2]

F              C              Am          G

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices

F            C            Am        G

In your pose as the dust settles around us

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

         F                   C

And the walls kept tumbling down

                   Am       G

In the city that we l-o-v-e-d

        F                   C

Great clouds roll over the hills

                       Am      G

Bringing darkness from a-b-o-v-e

 

 

[Chorus]

N.C.                   F

But if you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

 Am                 G

Nothing changed at all?

                       F

And if you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

 Am                 G

You've been here before?

     F                C         G

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

     F                C         G

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

 

 

[Instrumental]

F   C   Am   G

 

 

[Bridge]

F                 C

Oh where do we begin?

     Am            G

The rubble or our sins?

F                 C

Oh where do we begin?

     Am            G

The rubble or our sins?

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

         F                   C

And the walls kept tumbling down

                   Am       G

In the city that we l-o-v-e-d

        F                   C

Great clouds roll over the hills

                       Am      G

Bringing darkness from a-b-o-v-e

 

 

[Chorus]

N.C.                   F

But if you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

 Am                 G

Nothing changed at all?

                       F

And if you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

 Am                 G

You've been here before?

     F                C         G

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

     F                C         G

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

                  F

If you close your eyes,

         C

Does it almost feel like

Am                  G

Nothing changed at all?

 

 

[Outro]

F   C   Am   G (x2)
