WE ARE THE WORLD

[Verse 1]

C                            F        G     C

There comes a time when we heed a certain call

           F          G                C

When the world must come together as one

             Am

There are people dying

             Em                     Dm

Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life

    F                  G

The greatest gift of all

 

[Verse 2]

C               F         G     C

We can't go on pretending day by day

 F             G                          C

That someone, somewhere will soon make a change

Am                 Em

We're all a part of God's great big family

   Dm

And the truth

F         G

You know love is all we need

 

[Chorus]

            F   G                   C

We are the world, we are the children

            F                    G                  C

We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving

          Am                       Em

There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives

     Dm                       G                C

It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

 

[Verse 3]

C                                          F         G     C

Well, send them your heart so they know that someone cares

 F                   G              C

And their lives will be stronger and free

  Am                   Em

As God has shown us by turning stone to bread

Dm                                 G

And so we all must lend a helping hand

 

[Chorus]

            F   G                   C

We are the world, we are the children

            F                    G                  C

We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving

          Am                       Em

There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives

     Dm                       G                C

It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

 

[Bridge]

            Ab                 Bb                 C

When you're down and out there seems no hope at all

           Ab                   Bb              C

But if you just believe there's no way we can fall

                        Am             Em

Well, well, well, let's realize that a change can only come

     F

When we

                  G

stand together as one

 

[Chorus] (x2)

            F   G             C

We are the world, we are the children

            F                      G                  C

We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving

          Am                       Em

There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives

     Dm                       G                C

It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

 

[Chorus Coda] (a half step higher)

            Gb   Ab             Db

We are the world, we are the children

            Gb                      Ab                  Db

We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving

          Bbm                       Fm

There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives

     Ebm                      Ab               Db

It's true we'll make a better day just you and me (ad lib)
