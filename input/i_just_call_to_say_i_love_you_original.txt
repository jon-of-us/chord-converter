Stevie Wonder


[Intro]

| C | C Cmaj7/G | C | C

 

[Verse 1]

              C       Cmaj7/G C

No New Year`s day, to cele -  brate,

   Cmaj7/G   C                             Dm

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.

Dm          Dm   Dm             Dm7

  No first of spri-ing,  no song to sing,

Dm             Dm    Dm7    Gsus4 G    C     C

  In fact here`s just another ordi- nary day.

 

[Verse 2]

         C        Cmaj7/G C

No April rain, no flowers bloom,

   Cmaj7/G C                            Dm

No wedding Saturday within the month of June.

Dm          Dm Dm             Dm7

  But what it i- is, is something true,

Dm         Dm          Dm7        Gsus4  G      C     C

  Made up of these three words that I must say to you.

 

[Chorus]

       Dm        G     C            C

I just called to say I love you,

       Dm        G              Am      Am

I just called to say how much I care.

       Dm        G     Am        Am

I just called to say I love you,

      Dm7              Gsus4  G     C         C

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

 

[Verse 3]

            C        Cmaj7/G C

No summer`s high, no warm  July,

   Cmaj7/G C                               Dm

No harvest moon to light one tender August night.

Dm        Dm Dm            Dm7

  No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,

Dm       Dm                Gsus4  G        C     C

  Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.

 

[Verse 4]

         C       Cmaj7/G C

No Libra Sun, no Hallo - ween,

   Cmaj7/G C                                   Dm

No giving  thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.

Dm          Dm    Dm               Dm7

  But what it i-i-i-is, though old, so new.

Dm           Dm         Dm7      Gsus4       G    C     C

  To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.

 

[Chorus] (key change)

       Ebm       Ab    Db         Db

I just called to say I love you.

       Ebm       Ab             Bbm          Bbm

I just called to say how much I ca-a-are, I do.

       Ebm       Ab    Bbm       Bbm

I just called to say I love you.

      Ebm              Absus4 Ab    Db

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

 

[Chorus] (another key change)

       Em        A     D          D

I just called to say I love you.

       Em        A              Bm      Bm

I just called to say how much I care.

       Em        A     Bm       Bm

I just called to say I love you.

      Em               Asus4  A     D

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

 

[Coda]

                                 1 + 2 + 3

Bb    C      C     | D | % | % | D   D D D

Of my heart, of my heart.
