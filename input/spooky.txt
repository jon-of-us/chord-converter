[Verse 1]
      Am7
In the cool of the evening
        D6                           Am7     D6
When everything is getting kind of groovy
     Am7
You call me up and ask me
        D6                             Am7      D6
Would I like to go with you and see a movie?

Am7
First I say no, Ive got some plans for tonight
           D6              Ebdim
And then I stop        and say all right
Am7                           D6                     Am7     E7#9
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

 

 

[Verse 2]
      Am7
You always keep me guessing
   D6                               Am7     D6
I never seem to know what you are thinking
          Am7
And if a girl looks at you
         D6                             Am7      D6
It’s for sure your little eye will be a-winking
Am7
I get confused, I never know where I stand
             D6                  Ebdim
And then you smile          and hold my hand
Am7                           D6                     Am7
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
E7#9

If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are a-playing
      Am7                            D6                         Am7      D6
I’m gonna tell you all the things my hearts been a-dying to be saying
Am7
Just like a ghost you’ve been a-haunting my dreams
          D6                 Ebdim
But now I know        you're not what you seem
Am7                           D6                     Am7
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
E7#9
