LOVE ME LIKE THERES NO TOMORROW

Freddie Mercury

 

[Verse 1]

Em                         Am

 You had to kill the conversation,

D                        G

 you always had the upper hand,

C                                  Gadd9

 Got Caught In love and stepped in sinking sand,

D                       G

 you had to go and ruin all our plans

B                                   Em

 Packed your bags and you're leaving home,

      G                         D

got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go,

F#m                              B

 but we only have one more day together, so...

 

[Chorus]

 E                   G#m   A

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 F#m                              B

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 E                 G#m             A              F#m

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 F#m                          B          E

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow

 

[Verse 2]

Em                          Am

 I guess we drift alone in separate ways,

D                             G

 I don't have all that far to go,

C                               Gadd9

 God Knows I learnt to play the lonely man,

D                         G

 I've never felt so low in all my life,

B                       Em

 we were born to be Just losers,

      G                         D

so I guess there's a limit on how far we go,

F#m                              B

 but we only have one more day together, so...

 

[Chorus]

 E                   G#m   A

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 F#m                              B

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 E                 G#m             A              F#m

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 F#m                          B          E

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow

 

[Bridge]

 G                        D

Tomorrow God knows just where I'll be,

 G                       D

Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me

 Dm                            C                        G

Anything could happen but we only have one more day together, yeah,

 Gm                   C

Just one more day forever,

 

[Chorus]

 F                   Am   A#

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 Gm                              C

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 F                 Am             A#             Gm

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 Gm                          C          F

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow

 

 F                   Am   A#

Love me like there's no tomorrow,

 Gm                              C

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

 F                 Am             A#             Gm

This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,

 Gm                          C          F

but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
