IM STILL STANDING

[Intro]

 

 Gm  Cm7/G  D7/G  D#/D  F 

 
 Gm  Cm7/G  D7/G  D#/D  F 

 

[Verse 1]

 

G                      C/G

 You could never know what it's like

       D                         G

 your blood like winter freezes just like ice

               Am7/G                   C/G        D

 and there's a cold lonely light that shines from you

          Em                       C

 you'll wind up like the wreck you hide

             G    Am/G  G

 behind that mask you____use

 

 

[Verse 2]

 

G                                  C/G

 And did you think this fool could never win

       D                     G

 Well, look at me I'm comin' back again

         Am7/G              C/G    D

 I got a taste of love in a simple way

            Em                            C

 and if you need to know while I'm still standing,

          G    Am/G  G

 you just fade a______way

 

 

[Chorus]

 

                Gm7         Gm                   Dm7

 Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did

                Cm9                          D#maj7     F

 Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin'like a little kid

 Gm7         Gm            Dm7

 I'm still standing after all this time

                Cm9           Cm7             D7

 Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

 D7#9        Gm      Cm7          D7

 I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

 D7#9        Gm      Cm7          D7     D#/D  F

 I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah_____

 

 

[Verse 3]

 

G                      C/G

 Once I never could've hope to win

     D                              G

 you starting down the road leaving me again

     Am7/G                         C/G    D

 The threats you made were meant to cut me down

            Em               C

 and if our love was just a circus,

              G   Am/G  G

 you'd be a clown by_____now

 

 

[Chorus]

 

          Gm7         Gm                   Dm7

 You know I'm still standing better than I ever did

                Cm9                          D#maj7     F

 Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin'like a little kid

 Gm7         Gm            Dm7

 I'm still standing after all this time

                Cm9           Cm7             D7

 Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

 D7#9        Gm      Cm7          D7

 I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

 D7#9        Gm      Cm7          D7     D#/D  F
