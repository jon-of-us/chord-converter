[Verse 1]

D                   F#m     Bm

I hear the drums echoing tonight

D/A              C/G           Em         Bm  C  Bm Em

She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion

D                F#m           Bm

She's coming in, twelve thirty flight

        D/A        C/G                  Dsus/A            Bm  C  Bm Em

The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salva - tion

D            F#m               Bm

I stopped an old man along the way

       D/A         C/G           Dsus/A          Bm    C  Bm Em

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melo - dies

D            F#m         Bm                  C                  Em

He turned to me as if to say hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

 

[Chorus]

Am           F              C        G

Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Am                    F              C               G

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Am          F          C      G

I bless the rains down in  Africa

Am             F               C              Em  G  Am  G/B  C

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...

    C Bm Em

Ooo Ooo

    C Bm Em

 

[Verse 2]

D             F#m            Bm

The wild dogs cry out in the night

   D/A               C/G              Dsus/A  Bm   C Bm Em

As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny

D           F#m              Bm

I know that I must do what's right

           D/A        C/G         Dsus/A            Bm     C Bm Em

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Ser - engeti

D         F#m                Bm

I seek to cure what's deep inside

Bm                C                 Em

Frightened of this thing that I've become

 

[Chorus]

Am           F              C        G

Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Am                    F              C               G

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Am          F          C      G

I bless the rains down in  Africa

Am             F               C              Em  G  Am  G/B  C

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...

    C Bm Em

Ooo Ooo

    C Bm Em

C/G  Dsus/A  Bm   C  Bm Em

 

[Bridge]

D   F#7  Bm                   C                 Em

            hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

 

[Outro]

     Am          F               C        G

It’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Am                    F              C               G

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Am          F             C   G

I bless the rains down in Africa

Am          F             C   G

I bless the rains down in Africa

Am          F             C   G

I bless the rains down in Africa

Am          F             C   G

I bless the rains down in Africa

Am          F             C   G

I bless the rains down in Africa

Am             F              C               Em  G  Am  G/B  C

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had…

    C Bm Em

Ooo Ooo
