[Intro]

 

Am       D7       G

La la la la la la la   

            Cmaj7 F

La la la la la la la

Dm                E E7   E

La la la la la la l a

 

[Verse 1]

 

Am             D7                 G

 Now that I've lost everything to you

            Cmaj7                 F

You say you wanna start something new

         Dm                       E

And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'

E7        E

Baby, I'm grievin'

Am                D7               G

 But if you wanna leave, take good care

                Cmaj7                 F

Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear

           Dm                      E       G    G7

But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

 

[Chorus]

 

C    G                  F

 Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world

G                 F              C     C

 It's hard to get by just upon a smile

C    G                  F

 Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world

G              F                 C          Dm  E

 I'll always remember you like a child, girl

 

[Verse 2]

 

Am                    D7                        G

 You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do

         Cmaj7                F

And it's breakin' my heart in two

          Dm                    E

Because I never wanna see you a sad, girl

E7         E

Don't be a bad girl

Am                D7               G

 But if you wanna leave, take good care

                Cmaj7                   F

Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there

           Dm                           E     G   G7

But just remember there's a lot of bad, and beware

 

[Chorus]

 

C    G                  F

 Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world

G                 F              C     C

 It's hard to get by just upon a smile

C    G                  F

 Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world

G              F                 C          Dm  E

 I'll always remember you like a child, girl

 But if you wanna leave, take good care

Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there

           Dm                           E     G   G7

But just remember there's a lot of bad, and beware

 I'll always remember you like a child, girl
