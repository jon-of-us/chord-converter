Artist: Elton John
 

[Intro]

 

C G F 2x

 

[Verse]

 

G

Don't wish it away

      Em7     F                 C    F C F C F C

Don't look at it's like it's forever

C               G

Between you and me

                 Bm

I could honestly say

     F                   C     F C F C F C

That things can only get better

 

    C          G

And while I'm away,

B7                    Em

dust out the demons inside

                C

And it won't be long

       Em         G

Before you and me run

                    Am

To the place in our hearts

F        G   C G Am G

Where we hide

 

[Chorus]

 

      C

And I guess that's why

     G           F

they call it the blues

           C

Time on my hands,

         G               F

could be time spent with you

C             G

Laughing like children,

            Am

living like lovers,

C            F                  D

rolling like thunder, under the covers

      F

And I guess that's why

     G           C    Em F

they call it the blues

 

[Verse]

 

     G

Just stare into space

Em7        F            C    F C F C F C

Picture my face in your hands

C             G

Live for each second

            Bm

Without hesitation

    F                     C  F C F C F C

And never forget I'm your man

 

C          G

Wait on me girl

B7         Em          G

Cry in the night if it helps

    G7        C                  G

But more than ever I simply love you

            Am   F      G   C G Am G

More than I love life itself

 

[Chorus]

 

      C

And I guess that's why

     G           F

they call it the blues

           C

Time on my hands,

         G               F

could be time spent with you

C             G

Laughing like children,

            Am

living like lovers,

C            F                  D

rolling like thunder, under the covers

      F

And I guess that's why

     G           C     C G F

they call it the blues

 

[Verse]

 

C          G

Wait on me girl

B7         Em          G

Cry in the night if it helps

    G7        C                  G

But more than ever I simply love you

            Am   F      G   C G Am G

More than I love life itself

 

[Chorus]

 

      C

And I guess that's why

     G           F

they call it the blues

           C

Time on my hands,

         G               F

could be time spent with you

C             G

Laughing like children,

            Am

living like lovers,

C            F                  D

rolling like thunder, under the covers

      F

And I guess that's why

     G           C    Em F

they call it the blues

 

[Outro]

 

      F

And I guess that's why

     G           C

they call it the blues  2x
