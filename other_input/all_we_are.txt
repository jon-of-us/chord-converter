ALL WE ARE 
Artist: Jonah


C       Em               G    (D)
Wake up now and start to dream
C          Em           G
Hot nights wash away my fear
        D
Forever now
 
    C      Em             G   D
And I want you by my side
     C     Em                    G
Come on my dear we leave tonight
      D
Oh tonight
 
[Chorus]
 
C      Em                 G
All we are and all we are
D
We're just like oxygen
C          Em                 G  D
And all we are and all we are
 
C       Em               G     D
Wake up now and start to dream
C      Em
I wish you would stay
       G             D
Cause' you are all I need
 
    C      Em             G   D
And I want you by my side

Oh tonight

And all we are and all we are
