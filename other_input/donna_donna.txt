DONNA DONNA


Am E Am E
 
[Verse 1]
Am   E     Am        E     Am          Dm          Am       E
On a wagon bound for market  there's a calf with a mournful eye
Am      E        Am        E      Am        Dm      Am      E   Am
  High above him there's a swallow  winging swiftly through the sky
 
[Chorus]
G                  C        Am     G                    C     Am
 How the winds are laughing,  they laugh with all their might
G                    C         Am          E                 Am
 Laugh and laugh the whole day through and half the summer's night
E                 Am     G                 C   Am
Donna donna donna donna, donna donna donna don
E                 Am     E                 Am E Am E
Donna donna donna donna, donna donna donna don
 
[Verse 2]
 Am      E         Am       E     Am          Dm    Am      E
"Stop complaining" said the farmer  "Who told you a calf to be?
Am        E        Am       E       Am         Dm          Am    E   Am
Why don't you have wings to fly with  like the swallow, so proud and free?"
 
[Chorus]
G                  C        Am     G                    C     Am
 How the winds are laughing,  they laugh with all their might
G                    C         Am          E                 Am
 Laugh and laugh the whole day through and half the summer's night
E                 Am     G                 C   Am
Donna donna donna donna, donna donna donna don
E                 Am     E                 Am E Am E
Donna donna donna donna, donna donna donna don
 
[Verse 3]
Am         E      Am        E           Am      Dm          Am     E
Calves are easily bound and slaughtered,  never knowing the reason why
Am       E    Am        E       Am       Dm          Am      E  Am
  But whoever treasures freedom like the swallow has learned to fly
 
[Chorus]
G                  C        Am     G                    C     Am
 How the winds are laughing,  they laugh with all their might
G                    C         Am          E                 Am
 Laugh and laugh the whole day through and half the summer's night
E                 Am     G                 C   Am
Donna donna donna donna, donna donna donna don
E                 Am     E                 Am E Am E Am
Donna donna donna donna, donna donna donna don
