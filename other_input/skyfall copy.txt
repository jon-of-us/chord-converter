SKYFALL
Adele

[Intro]
Am   F   D   Dm   x3
Asus2/C    Esus  E
 
[Verse 1]
     Am        F   D
This is the end
Dm                   Am   F      D
Hold your breath and count to ten
Dm             Am       F    D
Feel the Earth move and then
Dm            Asus2/C Esus  E
Hear my heart burst again
 
[Verse 2]
         Am        F   D
For this is the end
     Dm                      Am  F   D
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
   Dm        Am    F   D
So overdue I owe them
Dm             Asus2/C  Esus  E
Swept away I'm sto  -  len
 
[Chorus]
        Am
Let the sky fall
Am/G    F
When it crumbles
F/E     D
We will stand tall
    D/C     Bm7b5 Esus E
And face it all together
 
        Am
Let the sky fall
Am/G    F
When it crumbles
F/E     D
We will stand tall
    D/C     Bm7b5
And face it all together
Esus E Am   F   D
At Skyfall
Dm    Am   F   D   Dm
At Skyfall
 
[Verse 3]
           Am          F   D
Skyfall is where we start
  Dm                 Am       F   D
A thousand miles and poles apart
      Dm                 Am         F
Where worlds collide and days are dark
                D               Dm
You may have my number, you can take my name
Asus2/C                          Esus  E
       But you'll never have my heart
 
[Chorus 2]
        Am
Let the sky fall
Am/G    F
When it crumbles
F/E     D
We will stand tall
    D/C     Bm7b5 Esus E
And face it all together
 
        Am
Let the sky fall
Am/G    F
When it crumbles
F/E     D
We will stand tall
    D/C     Bm7b5
And face it all together
Esus E Am
At Skyfall
 
(hold the Am)
 
[Bridge]
             Dm7/A
Where you go I go
     Esus/B  Asus2/C
What you see I see
            D                         Am
I know I'll never be me without the security
        F
of your loving arms
F/E     D
Keeping me from harm
         Bm7b5
Put your hand in my hand
          E
And we'll stand
 
[Chorus 3]
        Am
Let the sky fall
Am/G     F
When it crumbles
F/E     D
We will stand tall
    D/C     Bm7b5 Esus E
And face it all together
 
        Am
Let the sky fall
Am/G    F
When it crumbles
F/E     D
We will stand tall
    D/C     Bm7b5
And face it all together
Esus E Am
At Skyfall
