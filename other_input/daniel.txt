[Verse 1]
C                                Dm  
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane 
G                              E7          Am
 I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain 
       F         G                 Am
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye 
       F                 G7            F            C
God it looks like Daniel,  must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 2]
C                                          Dm 
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been 
G                                          E7        Am
 Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen 
       F         G                      Am
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough 
     F             G7     F           C
Lord I miss Daniel,  oh I miss him so much oh oh oh

[Chorus] 
F                         C
 Daniel my brother you are older than me 
             F                    C
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? 
               Am                         F
Your eyes have died but you see more than I 
Ab              C    A7                 Dm  G7
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky 
 
C Dm  G E7 Am  F G Am  F G7 F C  G7 F G7 F C
 
oh oh oh
 
[Chorus]
F                         C
Daniel my brother you are older than me 
             F                    C
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? 
               Am                         F
Your eyes have died but you see more than I 
Ab              C    A7                 Dm  G7
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
