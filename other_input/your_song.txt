Eb                Abmaj7      Bb/D                  Gm

It's a little bit funny        this feeling insi-i-ide

Cm             Cm/Bb                 Cm/Ab    Ab

I'm not one of those    who can     easily  hi-i-i-ide

Eb/Bb             Bb           G/B      Cm

don't have much money but,    boy if I did

Eb              Fm7           Ab                  Bb

  I'd buy a big house where,       we both could live

 

Eb         Abmaj7              Bb/D                     Gm

If I was a sculptor, heh,         but then again,     no

     Cm                Cm/Bb         Cm/A           Abmaj7

Or a man     who makes potions in a       traveling sho-o-o-ow, I

Eb/Bb            Bb                    G/B           Cm

   know it's not mu-uch, but it's the best      I can do-o-o

Eb                Fm7       Ab                   Eb  Ebsus  Eb

Bb/D         Cm                 Fm7                   Ab

   It may be quite simple bu-u-ut,      now that it's do-o-one

Cm                       Cm/Bb

   I hope you don't mind,     I hope you don't mind,

Cm/A                   Ab

    that I put down in words

    Eb/G      Cm/Ab           Ab               Bb

How wonderful life is, while you're in the world

       Cm           Cm/Bb                      Cm/A          Abmaj7

Eb/Bb                   Bb               G/B                 Cm

   But the sun's been quite ki-i-ind,    while I wrote this so-o-ong

Eb                  Fm7            Ab           Bb

It's for people like you tha-a-at     keep it turned on

 

Eb                 Ab       Bb/D                    Gm

   So excuse me forgettin       but these things I do-o-o-o

Cm               Cm/Bb                   Cm/A              Ab

   You see I've forgotten    if they're green    or they're blu-u-ue

Eb/Bb                    Bb              G/B       Cm

   Anyway the-thing-is, what-I-really me-e-e-ean

Eb                 Fm7                  Ab                     Eb Ebsus Eb

   Yours are the sweetest e-e-e---e-e-eyes    I've ever seen

[Chorus]

 

Bb/D                Cm         Fm7              Ab

Bb/D         Cm                 Fm7                   Ab

   It may be quite simple bu-u-ut,      now that it's do-o-one

Cm                       Cm/Bb

   I hope you don't mind,     I hope you don't mind,

Cm/A                  Ab

    that I put down in words

    Eb/G      Fm/Ab           Ab               Bb

How wonderful life is, while you're in the world

How wonderful life is, while you're in the world
