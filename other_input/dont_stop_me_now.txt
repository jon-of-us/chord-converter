DONT STOP ME NOW

[Intro]
  F                      Am          Dm                Gm   C
Tonight I’m gonna have myself a real good time, I feel alive
        F           F7              Bb           Gm7                D7
And the world, I’ll turn it inside out yeah, I'm floating around in ecstasy
   Gm    F    C  Gm   Gm    F    C
So don’t stop me now, don’t stop me
          Gm       F/G  Gm7   C        Dm7/C C7
Cause I’m having a good time, having a good  time
 
[Verse 1]
      F                                 Am           Dm
I’m a shooting star leaping through the sky, like a tiger
             Gm          C
Defying the laws of gravity
      F                  Am               Dm
I’m a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva
          Gm          C                    F
I’m gonna go, go, go, there’s no stopping me
 
[Pre-chorus]
    F7                   Bb           Gm7
I’m burning through the sky yeah, two hundred degrees
                D7                Gm
That’s why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
    D7                         Gm
I’m travelling at the speed of light
               Gm7        F/A   Bb      Bdim C
I wanna make a su - per - sonic man out of   you
 
[Chorus]
F     Gm   Am Dm                     Gm7             C
Don’t stop me now, I’m having such a good time, I’m having a ball
F     Gm   Am Dm                       Gm7             D7
Don’t stop me now, if you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Gm    F    C             Gm                Gm7
Don’t stop me now, cause I’m having a good time
Gm    F    C           Gm
Don’t stop me now, yes I’m having a good time
  C                    Bb
I don’t wanna stop at all
 
[Verse 2]
      F                        Am            Dm
I’m a rocket ship on my way to Mars, on a collision course
      Gm         C
I’m a satellite, I’m out of control
      F                      Am            Dm
I’m a sex machine ready to reload, like an atom bomb
         Gm  F/G Gm7 C   Dm7/C C7  F
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh    explode
 
[Pre-chorus]
    F7                   Bb           Gm7
I’m burning through the sky yeah, two hundred degrees
                D7                Gm
That’s why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
    D7                        Gm
I’m traveling at the speed of light
               Gm7 (no3)  F/A   Bb    Bdim C
I wanna make a su - per - sonic woman of   you
