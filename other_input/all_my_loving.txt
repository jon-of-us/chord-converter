ALL MY LOVING 

The Beatles  1963


 

G          Em             A7

Close your eyes, and I'll kiss you,

  D           Bm

Tomorrow I'll miss you,

  G           Em        C   A7

Remember I'll always be true.

         Em         A7

And then while I'm away,

           D         Bm

I'll write home everyday,

         G           A7        D

And I'll send all my loving to you.

 

G       Em            A7

I'll pretend that I'm kissing,

    D             Bm

The lips that I'm missing,

    G            Em               C   A7

And hope that my dreams will come true.

         Em         A7

And then while I'm away,

           D         Bm

I'll write home everyday,

         G           A7        D

And I'll send all my loving to you.
