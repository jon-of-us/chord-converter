[Verse]

Cmaj7     B7                Em7          Dm7    G7    Cmaj7

I see the crystal raindrops fall and the beauty of it all 

            B7                Em      Em7

is when the sun comes shining through

Cmaj7              B7             Em7         Dm7      G7       Cmaj7

     To make those rainbows in my mind when I think of you some time 

              B7                   Em   Em7

and I want to spend some time with you

 

[Chorus]

         Cmaj7     B7         Em7           Dm7  G7       Cmaj7

Just the two of us     We can make it if we try. Just the two of us 

B7            Em        Em7

    (Just the Two of Us)

         Cmaj7     B7           Em7            Dm7  G7       Cmaj7

Just the two of us     building castles in the sky. Just the two of us,  

B7           Em   Em7

     You and I
