VIVA LA VIDA
Coldplay

[Intro]

F   G   C   Am   x2

 

 

[Verse 1]

          F        G

I used to rule the world

           C                    Am

Seas would rise when I gave the word

                     F      G

Now in the morning I sleep alone

          C                 Am

Sweep the streets I used to own

 

 

[Interlude]

F   G   C   Am   x2

 

 

[Verse 2]

          F        G

I used to roll the dice

         C                  Am

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

              F           G

Listen as the crowd would sing:

         C                      Am

"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

             F        G

One minute I held the key

         C                    Am

Next the walls were closed on me

                         F       G

And I discovered that my castles stand

     C                       Am

Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

 

 

[Chorus]

  F              G

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

C             Am

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

F                G

Be my mirror, my sword, and shield

   C                 Am

My missionaries in a foreign field

F                 G

For some reason I can't explain

C                         Am              F      G

Once you'd gone there was never, never an honest word

         Em               Am

That was when I ruled the world

 

 

[Interlude]

F   G   C   Am   x2

 

 

[Verse 3]

                      F    G

It was the wicked and wild wind

              C               Am

Blew down the doors to let me in

                          F        G

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

       C                     Am

People couldn't believe what I'd become

         F      G

Revolutionaries wait

       C                Am

For my head on a silver plate

                   F      G

Just a puppet on a lonely string

    C                         Am

Oh, who would ever want to be king?

 

 

[Chorus]

  F              G

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

C             Am

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

F                G

Be my mirror, my sword, and shield

   C                 Am

My missionaries in a foreign field

F                 G

For some reason I can't explain

  C                      Am

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

         F      G

Never an honest word

             Em               Am

But that was when I ruled the world

 

 

[Interlude]

F   Am   x3

G   G

 

  F   G    C   Am

Ohhhhhh  Ohhhhhhh

  F   G    C   Am

Ohhhhhh  Ohhhhhhh

 

 

[Chorus]

  F              G

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

C             Am

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

F                G

Be my mirror, my sword, and shield

   C                 Am

My missionaries in a foreign field

F                 G

For some reason I can't explain

  C                      Am

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

         F      G

Never an honest word

             Em               Am

But that was when I ruled the world

 

 

[Outro]

F    G  Em   Am

Oooooh  Ooooooh

F    G  Em   Am

Oooooh  Ooooooh
