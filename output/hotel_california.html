<b>0n</b>                         <b>1jd</b>
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
<b>10j</b>                    <b>11j</b>
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
<b>8j</b>                         <b>9j</b>
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
<b>11n</b>
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
<b>1jd</b>
  I had to stop for the night
 
<b>0n</b>                               <b>1jd</b>
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
<b>10j</b>
  And I was thinking to myself
              <b>11j</b>
This could be heaven or this could be hell
<b>8j</b>                         <b>9j</b>
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
<b>11n</b>
   There were voices down the corridor,
<b>1jd</b>
  I thought I heard them say...
 
<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<b>8j</b>                         <b>9j</b>
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
       <b>1jd</b>                                        <b>0n</b>
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
<b>8j</b>                              <b>9j</b>
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    <b>11n</b>                                      <b>1jd</b>
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here
 
<b><big>[Verse]</big></b>
<b>0n</b>                            <b>1jd</b>
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
<b>10j</b>                                  <b>11j</b>
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
<b>8j</b>                                  <b>9j</b>
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
<b>11n</b>                      <b>1jd</b>
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
<b>0n</b>                           <b>1jd</b>
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
<b>10j</b>                                   <b>11j</b>
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
<b>8j</b>                                        <b>9j</b>
  and still those voices are calling from far away
<b>11n</b>
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
<b>1jd</b>
  Just to hear them say...
 
<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<b>8j</b>                        <b>9j</b>
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
       <b>1jd</b>                                        <b>0n</b>
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        <b>8j</b>                            <b>9j</b>
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       <b>11n</b>                                              <b>1jd</b>
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
 
<b><big>[Verse]</big></b>
<b>0n</b>                        <b>1jd</b>
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
<b>10j</b>                              <b>11j</b>
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
<b>8j</b>                             <b>9j</b>
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
<b>11n</b>
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
<b>1jd</b>
just can't kill the beast
 
<b>0n</b>                             <b>1jd</b>
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
<b>10j</b>                                     <b>11j</b>
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
<b>8j</b>                                  <b>9j</b>
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
<b>11n</b>
  You can check out any time you like
<b>1jd</b>
 But you can never leave...
