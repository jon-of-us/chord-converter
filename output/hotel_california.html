  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
</pre>

<pre>●N                         ●+JD 
   There were voices down the corridor,

  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
▲+                     -●J 
This could be heaven or this could be hell

  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
-▲                         ▲ 
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
-●N

●+JD 
  I had to stop for the night
●N                               ●+JD 
F                               C

  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
▲+ 
  And I was thinking to myself
              -●J 
  I had to stop for the night

-●N 
●+JD 
  I thought I heard them say...</pre>

       ●+JD                                       ●N 
  and still those voices are calling from far away

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    -●N                                      ●+JD 
Am                           E7

Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here</pre>

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face

 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends

  I thought I heard them say...

  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
▲+                                    -●J 
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

-▲                                        ▲ 
F                                         C

   Wake you up in the middle of the night
●+JD 
  Just to hear them say...</pre>

<pre>   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
▲+                               -●J 
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends

-▲                             ▲ 
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
-●N 
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
●+JD 
just can't kill the beast
●N                             ●+JD 
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
▲+                                      -●J 
   Wake you up in the middle of the night

-▲                                  ▲ 
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
-●N 
  You can check out any time you like
●+JD 
 But you can never leave...</pre>
