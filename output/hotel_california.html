<b><big>[Verse]</big></b>
<pre><b>●                          ●+JD </b>
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
<b>▲+                     ●-J </b>
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air

<b>▲-                         ▲ </b>
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light

<b>●- </b>
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim

<b>●+JD </b>
  I had to stop for the night

<b>●                                ●+JD </b>
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell

<b>▲+ </b>
  And I was thinking to myself

<b>              ●-J </b>
This could be heaven or this could be hell

<b>▲-                         ▲ </b>
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way

<b>●- </b>
   There were voices down the corridor,

<b>●+JD </b>
  I thought I heard them say...
</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-                         ▲ </b>
  Welcome to the Hotel California.

<b>       ●+JD                                       ● </b>
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face

<b>▲-                              ▲ </b>
Plenty of room at the Hotel California

<b>    ●-                                       ●+JD </b>
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here
</pre>


<b><big>[Verse]</big></b>
<pre><b>●                             ●+JD </b>
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends

<b>▲+                                   ●-J </b>
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends

<b>▲-                                  ▲ </b>
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat

<b>●-                       ●+JD </b>
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

<b>●                            ●+JD </b>
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)

<b>▲+                                    ●-J </b>
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969

<b>▲-                                        ▲ </b>
  and still those voices are calling from far away

<b>●- </b>
   Wake you up in the middle of the night

<b>●+JD </b>
  Just to hear them say...
</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-                        ▲ </b>
 Welcome to the Hotel California.

<b>       ●+JD                                       ● </b>
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face

<b>        ▲-                            ▲ </b>
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California

<b>       ●-                                               ●+JD </b>
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
</pre>

<pre><b>●                         ●+JD </b>
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)

<b>▲+                               ●-J </b>
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device

<b>▲-                             ▲ </b>
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast

<b>●- </b>
 They stab it with their steely knives but they

<b>●+JD </b>
just can't kill the beast

<b>●                              ●+JD </b>
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door

<b>▲+                                      ●-J </b>
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

<b>▲-                                  ▲ </b>
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive

<b>●- </b>
  You can check out any time you like

<b>●+JD </b>
 But you can never leave...
