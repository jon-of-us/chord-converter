<h2>LOVE ME LIKE THERES NO TOMORROW
</h2>
Freddie Mercury


<b><big>[Verse 1]
</big></b>
<b>11n</b>                        <b>10n</b>
 You had to kill the conversation,
<b>9j</b>                       <b>8j</b>
 you always had the upper hand,
<b>7j</b>                                 Fadd9
 Got Caught In love and stepped in sinking sand,
<b>9j</b>                      <b>8j</b>
 you had to go and ruin all our plans
<b>0j</b>                                  <b>11n</b>
 Packed your bags and you're leaving home,
      <b>8j</b>                        <b>9j</b>
got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go,
<b>1n</b>                              <b>0j</b>
 but we only have one more day together, so...


<b><big>[Chorus]
</big></b>
 <b>11j</b>                 <b>3n</b>    <b>10j</b>
Love me like there's no tomorrow,
 <b>1n</b>                              <b>0j</b>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
 <b>11j</b>               <b>3n</b>              <b>10j</b>            <b>1n</b>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,
 <b>1n</b>                          <b>0j</b>         <b>11j</b>
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow


<b><big>[Verse 2]
</big></b>
<b>11n</b>                         <b>10n</b>
 I guess we drift alone in separate ways,
<b>9j</b>                            <b>8j</b>
 I don't have all that far to go,
<b>7j</b>                              Fadd9
 God Knows I learnt to play the lonely man,
<b>9j</b>                        <b>8j</b>
 I've never felt so low in all my life,
<b>0j</b>                      <b>11n</b>
 we were born to be Just losers,
      <b>8j</b>                        <b>9j</b>
so I guess there's a limit on how far we go,
<b>1n</b>                              <b>0j</b>
 but we only have one more day together, so...


<b><big>[Chorus]
</big></b>
 <b>11j</b>                 <b>3n</b>    <b>10j</b>
Love me like there's no tomorrow,
 <b>1n</b>                              <b>0j</b>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
 <b>11j</b>               <b>3n</b>              <b>10j</b>            <b>1n</b>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,
 <b>1n</b>                          <b>0j</b>         <b>11j</b>
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow


<b><big>[Bridge]
</big></b>
 <b>8j</b>                       <b>9j</b>
Tomorrow God knows just where I'll be,
 <b>8j</b>                      <b>9j</b>
Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me
 <b>9n</b>                            <b>7j</b>                       <b>8j</b>
Anything could happen but we only have one more day together, yeah,
 <b>8n</b>                   <b>7j</b>
Just one more day forever,


<b><big>[Chorus]
</big></b>
 <b>6j</b>                  <b>10n</b>  <b>5j</b>
Love me like there's no tomorrow,
 <b>8n</b>                              <b>7j</b>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
 <b>6j</b>                <b>10n</b>            <b>5j</b>             <b>8n</b>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over,
 <b>8n</b>                          <b>7j</b>         <b>6j</b>
but today just love me like there's no tomorrow
 <b>6j</b>                  <b>10n</b>  <b>5j</b>
Love me like there's no tomorrow,

Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it
