<h2>YOUR SONG</h2>


<b><big>[Intro]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲   ▲-  ▲+  ▲- </b></pre>


<b><big>[Verse 1]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲                 ▲-JN   ▲+/4             ●+ </b>
It's a little bit funny,   this feeling inside
<b>●              ●/10       ●/9       ▲-JN </b>
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
<b>▲                  ▲+       ●+J       ● </b>
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
<b>▲             ●-NJ       ▲-              ▲+ </b>
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
<b>▲             ▲-JN   ▲+/4              ●+ </b>
If I was a sculptor,   but then again, no
<b>     ●             ●/10       ●/9          ▲- </b>
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
<b>   ▲             ▲+                ●+J      ● </b>
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
<b>▲              ●-NJ    ▲-               ▲ </b>
My gift is my song, and this one's for you</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲+/4              ●       ●-NJ           ▲-JN </b>
And you can tell everybody this is your song
<b>▲+/4       ●             ●-               ▲- </b>
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
<b>●                     ●/10 </b>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<b>●/9                 ▲-J9 </b>
That I put down in words,
<b>      ▲/4     ●-            ▲-            ▲+ </b>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world</pre>


<b><big>[Interlude]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲   ▲-  ▲+  ▲- </b></pre>


<b><big>[Verse 2]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲            ▲-JN   ▲+/4                 ●+ </b>
I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss
<b>        ●           ●/10              ●/9            ▲-JN </b>
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
<b>▲                    ▲+       ●+J                 ● </b>
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
<b>▲                    ●-NJ    ▲-               ▲+ </b>
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
<b>▲               ▲-JN     ▲+/4                ●+ </b>
So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do
<b>●                ●/10              ●/9              ▲-JN </b>
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
<b>▲                  ▲+                ●+J   ● </b>
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
<b>▲               ●-NJ       ▲-             ▲ </b>
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲+/4              ●       ●-NJ           ▲- </b>
And you can tell everybody this is your song
<b>▲+/4       ●             ●-               ▲- </b>
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
<b>●                     ●/10 </b>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<b>●/9                 ▲-J9 </b>
That I put down in words,
<b>      ▲        ●-            ▲-             ▲+ </b>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
<b>●                    ●/10 </b>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<b>●/9                 ▲-J9 </b>
That I put down in words,
<b>     ▲/4      ●-            ▲-            ▲       ▲-/7  ▲+/5  ▲-/7  ▲ </b>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world</pre>
