In the cool of the evening
        D6                           <b>0nj</b>     D6
When everything is getting kind of groovy
     <b>0nj</b>
You call me up and ask me
        D6                             <b>0nj</b>      D6
Would I like to go with you and see a movie?
<b>0nj</b>
First I say no, Ive got some plans for tonight
           D6              <b>6d</b>
And then I stop        and say all right
<b>0nj</b>                           D6                     <b>0nj</b>     E7#9
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessing
   D6                               <b>0nj</b>     D6
I never seem to know what you are thinking
          <b>0nj</b>
And if a girl looks at you
         D6                             <b>0nj</b>      D6
It’s for sure your little eye will be a-winking
<b>0nj</b>
I get confused, I never know where I stand
             D6                  <b>6d</b>
And then you smile          and hold my hand
<b>0nj</b>                           D6                     <b>0nj</b>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are a-playing
      <b>0nj</b>                            D6                         <b>0nj</b>      D6
I’m gonna tell you all the things my hearts been a-dying to be saying
<b>0nj</b>
Just like a ghost you’ve been a-haunting my dreams
          D6                 <b>6d</b>
But now I know        you're not what you seem
<b>0nj</b>                           D6                     <b>0nj</b>
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
