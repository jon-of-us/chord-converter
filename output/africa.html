<b><big>[Verse 1]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲+                  ●++     ●+ </b>
I hear the drums echoing tonight
<b>▲+/7             ▲-/7          ●          ●+  ▲- ●+ ● </b>
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
<b>▲+               ●++           ●+ </b>
She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
<b>        ▲+/7       ▲-/7                 ●--P5/7           ●+  ▲- ●+ ● </b>
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salva - tion
<b>▲+           ●++               ●+ </b>
I stopped an old man along the way
<b>       ▲+/7        ▲-/7          ●--P5/7         ●+    ▲- ●+ ● </b>
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melo - dies
<b>▲+           ●++         ●+                  ▲-                 ● </b>
He turned to me as if to say hurry boy, it's waiting there for you</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>●-           ▲--            ▲-       ▲ </b>
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
<b>●-                    ▲--            ▲-              ▲ </b>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
<b>●-          ▲--        ▲-     ▲ </b>
I bless the rains down in  Africa
<b>●-             ▲--             ▲-             ●   ▲  ●-  ▲/4  ▲- </b>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...
<b>    ▲- ●+ ● </b>
Ooo Ooo
<b>    ▲- ●+ ● </b></pre>


<b><big>[Verse 2]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲+            ●++            ●+ </b>
The wild dogs cry out in the night
<b>   ▲+/7              ▲-/7             ●--P5/7 ●+   ▲- ●+ ● </b>
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
<b>▲+          ●++              ●+ </b>
I know that I must do what's right
<b>           ▲+/7       ▲-/7        ●--P5/7           ●+     ▲- ●+ ● </b>
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Ser - engeti
<b>▲+        ●++                ●+ </b>
I seek to cure what's deep inside
<b>●+                ▲-                ● </b>
Frightened of this thing that I've become</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>●-           ▲--            ▲-       ▲ </b>
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
<b>●-          ▲--        ▲-     ▲ </b>
I bless the rains down in  Africa
<b>●-             ▲--             ▲-             ●   ▲  ●-  ▲/4  ▲- </b>
