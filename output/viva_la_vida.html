<h2>VIVA LA VIDA</h2>
<pre>Coldplay</pre>


<b><big>[Intro]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-  ▲+  ▲   ●    x2 </b></pre>


<b><big>[Verse 1]</big></b>
<pre><b>          ▲-       ▲+ </b>
I used to rule the world
<b>           ▲                    ● </b>
Seas would rise when I gave the word
<b>                     ▲-     ▲+ </b>
Now in the morning I sleep alone
<b>          ▲                 ● </b>
Sweep the streets I used to own</pre>


<b><big>[Interlude]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-  ▲+  ▲   ●    x2 </b></pre>


<b><big>[Verse 2]</big></b>
<pre><b>          ▲-       ▲+ </b>
I used to roll the dice
<b>         ▲                  ● </b>
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
<b>              ▲-          ▲+ </b>
Listen as the crowd would sing:
<b>         ▲                      ● </b>
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
<b>             ▲-       ▲+ </b>
One minute I held the key
<b>         ▲                    ● </b>
Next the walls were closed on me
<b>                         ▲-      ▲+ </b>
And I discovered that my castles stand
<b>     ▲                       ● </b>
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>  ▲-             ▲+ </b>
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
<b>▲             ● </b>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
<b>▲-               ▲+ </b>
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
<b>   ▲                 ● </b>
My missionaries in a foreign field
<b>▲-                ▲+ </b>
For some reason I can't explain
<b>▲                         ●               ▲-     ▲+ </b>
Once you'd gone there was never, never an honest word
<b>         ●+               ● </b>
That was when I ruled the world</pre>


<b><big>[Interlude]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-  ▲+  ▲   ●    x2 </b></pre>


<b><big>[Verse 3]</big></b>
<pre><b>                      ▲-   ▲+ </b>
It was the wicked and wild wind
<b>              ▲               ● </b>
Blew down the doors to let me in
<b>                          ▲-       ▲+ </b>
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
<b>       ▲                     ● </b>
People couldn't believe what I'd become
<b>         ▲-     ▲+ </b>
Revolutionaries wait
<b>       ▲                ● </b>
For my head on a silver plate
<b>                   ▲-     ▲+ </b>
Just a puppet on a lonely string
<b>    ▲                         ● </b>
Oh, who would ever want to be king?</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>  ▲-             ▲+ </b>
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
<b>▲             ● </b>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
<b>▲-               ▲+ </b>
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
<b>   ▲                 ● </b>
My missionaries in a foreign field
<b>▲-                ▲+ </b>
For some reason I can't explain
<b>  ▲                      ● </b>
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
<b>         ▲-     ▲+ </b>
Never an honest word
<b>             ●+               ● </b>
But that was when I ruled the world</pre>


<b><big>[Interlude]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-  ●    x3 </b>
<b>▲+  ▲+ </b>
<b>  ▲-  ▲+   ▲   ● </b>
Ohhhhhh  Ohhhhhhh
<b>  ▲-  ▲+   ▲   ● </b>
Ohhhhhh  Ohhhhhhh</pre>


<b><big>[Chorus]</big></b>
<pre><b>  ▲-             ▲+ </b>
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
<b>▲             ● </b>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
<b>▲-               ▲+ </b>
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
<b>   ▲                 ● </b>
My missionaries in a foreign field
<b>▲-                ▲+ </b>
For some reason I can't explain
<b>  ▲                      ● </b>
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
<b>         ▲-     ▲+ </b>
Never an honest word
<b>             ●+               ● </b>
But that was when I ruled the world</pre>


<b><big>[Outro]</big></b>
<pre><b>▲-   ▲+ ●+   ● </b>
Oooooh  Ooooooh
<b>▲-   ▲+ ●+   ● </b>
Oooooh  Ooooooh</pre>
